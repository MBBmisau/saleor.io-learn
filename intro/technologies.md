Our storefront will be built in React.js using the Next.js framework. Those two solutions will be complemented with TypeScript, GraphQL & Apollo Client and Tailwind CSS.

## React.js

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It makes creating interactive UIs simple and streamlined. React is specifically designed for single-page applications. Its goal is to be fast, scalable, and simple.

## Next.js

Next.js is a React.js framework built on top of Node.js. It enables functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. The Next.js framework utilizes JAMstack architecture, which distinguishes between front-end and back-end and allows for efficient front-end development that is independent of any back-end APIs.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. It is a superset of JavaScript that provides optional static typing, classes, and interfaces. One of the biggest benefits of using TypeScript is to make IDEs provide a richer environment so that you can see common errors as you type the code easier and faster.

## GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for APIs that prioritizes giving clients exactly the data they request and no more. GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. As an alternative to REST, GraphQL lets developers construct requests that pull data from multiple data sources in a single API call. Additionally, GraphQL gives API maintainers the flexibility to add or deprecate fields without impacting existing queries. Developers can build APIs with whatever methods they prefer, and the GraphQL specification will ensure they function in predictable ways to clients.

## Apollo Client

Apollo Client is a comprehensive state management JavaScript library for GraphQL. It enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. You can use it to fetch, cache, and modify application data, and the library will take care of it while automatically updating your UI. Apollo Client helps you structure code in an economical, predictable, and declarative way that's consistent with modern development practices. 

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build complex components from a constrained set of primitive utilities like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center`, and `rotate-90`, directly in your markup. The framework provides a wide variety of predefined classes where each has its own focused use. This approach makes it easier to quickly test and check how CSS styles are applied on web pages.
