In this tutorial, you are going to build a **storefront** from scratch and hook it up to Saleor API. A storefront is an e-commerce frontend application that enables customers to interact with your shop using various devices. It could be in the browser as a web application, on their phones through a mobile app, or even via custom devices, such as digital kiosks.

In the following sections, we will walk you through setting up your very own Saleor Storefront while exploring key aspects ranging from product and performance optimisations to creating checkout. Feel free to go section by section or hop around to the parts most relevant to your needs.
