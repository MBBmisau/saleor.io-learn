Path Alias is a TypeScript configuration that maps a custom alias to a path in your project. Thanks to path aliases, the import statements are short and more convenient to use.

Let's declare a couple of aliases for components, the auto-generated Saleor typings, and the location of GraphQL statements. Open `tsconfig.json` and add the following `paths` section under `compilerOptions`. We also need to set the `baseUrl` to make the path aliases work in Next.js.

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/components": ["components"],
      "@/components/*": ["components/*"],
      "@/saleor/api": ["saleor/api"],
      "@/graphql": ["graphql"],
      "@/lib": ["lib"]
    }
  }
}
```

This path configuration will allow us to directly reference the files in the `components`, `saleor/api`, `graphql` and `lib` directories from anywhere in the project tree.
